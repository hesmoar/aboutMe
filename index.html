      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Problem-solving and goal-oriented Producer with a versatile skill set, bringing a unique perspective gained from experience across Pipeline/IT, Production, and Artist levels. With hands-on expertise in production management, compositing, and editing, I am always looking to promote a safe and healthy environment for the studio and the artists.

Reliable and adaptable, I have a proven track record of successful collaboration with artist teams and technicians across various disciplines, both on a project and studio level. I also have experience using Python to optimize workflows, enhancing productivity and efficiency within the team.

I am always looking for new opportunities to grow, collaborate with creative teams, and contribute to innovative projects that push the boundaries of storytelling and production.</p>
